<li>
<p>Create a Fork of the "Official" Repo</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A "fork" is essentially a server-side clone of a Git repository. In the pure git world this can be done with a <code>git clone</code> command on the Git server, but GitHub provides us a <strong>fork</strong> button to do this, just click it (in the upper right) and confirm you want to fork the repository into your own namespace.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone your fork</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This one is pretty self explanatory. Just make sure you clone <em>your</em> fork and not the official fork.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git clone git@github.com/etsauer/git-flow.git</pre>
</div>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set your local clone up to track the "Upstream" fork</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I clone a repository locally, that <em>thing</em> is appropriately referred to as your <em>local repository</em>. By default, when I run a <code>git clone</code>, git automatically sets up that <em>local repo</em> to track the <em>remote repository</em> I cloned from. However, since we cloned from our fork of the "official" repo, our <em>local repo</em> is now tracking our fork. In order to keep up with changes being made to the official repo, we want to set up our <em>local repo</em> to track the official fork, in addition to our own. This is called <em>adding a remote</em>. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git remote add upstream git@github.com/redhat-cop/git-flow.git</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the command we ran is <code>git remote add</code>, then we gave it the name "upstream" and passed the Git URL to that <em>remote</em>. For the record, "upstream" is the common name used to refer to the official fork of a git project, but I could have named it "official" or "nutter-butter" for all git cares.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-your-fork-up-to-date">Keeping Your Fork Up-to-date</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As time goes on and people contribute to the project, it&#8217;s possible that the <em>upstream</em> repo will drift apart from your fork. It is your responsibility to make sure you are keeping your fork up to date with the latest changes from <em>upstream</em>. Usually this means making sure that the <em>default</em> branch of your repo is in the same state as the <em>default</em> branch of your fork. You can do this by occasionally pulling updates from upstream to your fork.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Usually the <em>default</em> branch of a repo is the "master" branch, but it&#8217;s possible for some repos it could be something else. In GitHub, it&#8217;s easy to know just by looking at whatever branch is the active one when you navigate to the main repo page, or do a <code>git clone</code>.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two methods for updating your fork. Both are explained below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="option-1-rebase-recommended">Option 1: Rebase (Recommended)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a <em>rebase</em> you are essentially telling git to, first, copy the entire state of a remote branch to your local repo, then take any detected changes in my local copy and overlay them on top of the clean remote clone.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git checkout master # Make sure your local repo is on the master branch
git fetch upstream # Scan the remote for any updates
git rebase upstream/master # Rebase my local master on top of the master branch of upstream</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your local master branch is now up-to-date. However, this did not update your remote fork. To do that you have to push</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git push</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="option-2-merge">Option 2: Merge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>merge</em> is almost the exact opposite of a <em>rebase</em>. Instead of using the remote repo as the base, I&#8217;m going to use my local copy as the base, and attempt to overlay any changes since my last merge on top of my current branch. One of the advantages of a <em>merge</em> is that you get to see some output of the commits and files that have changed if that is of interest. The downside is that merging has the potential to cause more conflicts if you&#8217;ve made changes to your local copy <em>AND</em> changes have been made upstream.</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>git checkout master
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master</pre>
