<p>Contributions from the community play an important role in the assets associated with the Red Hat Communities of Practice (CoP). One of these sources of content is through source code repositories hosted on GitHub within the <a href="https://github.com/redhat-cop">redhat-cop</a> organization. These repositories have a direct relationship to one or more tracks within a CoP or across multiple CoP’s and help drive the overall mission of the CoP program.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All members of the Open Source Community are welcome to contribute to the Red Hat Communities of Practice. Contributions to CoP source code repositories can be received through a variety of methods including source code contributions, reviews and issue creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Individuals who are interested in directly affecting repository content may request the privilege in becoming a committer in one or more CoP sponsored repository for which they have made contributions in the past. Committers play an important role within a CoP and act as an extension of the core team to help facilitate key initiatives that benefit the entire community as a whole. These individuals may request commit access or be nominated by another member of the community. All requests for committer status will be reviewed by members of the Community of Practice along with the track lead(s) for which the repository is associated.</p>

<p>Create a pull request back to the originating repository being sure to follow any specific guidelines outlined in the repository</p>
